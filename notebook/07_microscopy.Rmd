## Light microscopy
* Bright field images of:
  * Coccomyxa viridis culture
  * Crossections of Xanthoria thallus
* Saved lif file as `data/microscopy/coccomyxa_brightfield.lif` and `data/microscopy/xanthoria_crossection.lif` 
* Saved images at `data/microscopy/bright_field`

## Confocal microscopy
* With Xia, made confocal images of Coccomyxa viridis and Trebouxia isolated from Xanthoria (see `../08_isoaltion_trebouxia`)
* Stained cultures with calcouflour white
  * Used calcofluor white solution from SIGMA + a drop of 1M NaOH
  * Stained for 3 min
* Imaged on Leica SP8 with 410 nm excitation and 410-430 emission for CFW, and 650-730 for chlorophyll autofluorescence
* Saved lif files as `data/microscopy/Coccomyxa_confocal*.lif` and `data/microscopy/Trebouxia.lif` 
* Saved images at `data/microscopy/confocal`
